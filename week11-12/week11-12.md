### Project GreenPrint

For this project we decided to break it into two apps. We built a frontend app that would connect to our backend app. 

[Frontend](https://github.com/jonesandy/Project_Greenprint_Frontend) app repository.  Live app located [here](https://project-greenprint.herokuapp.com/).

[Backend](https://github.com/jonesandy/Project_Greenprint_Backend) app repository with details on how to use it.
