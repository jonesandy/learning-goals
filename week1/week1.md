# Week 1 goals

By the end of the week I will be able to:

1. **Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods.** :white_check_mark:
2. **Pair using the driver-navigator style.** :white_check_mark:
3. **Follow an effective debugging process.**
4. **Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP.**


## Evidence

1. **Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods.**

  * **Boris-Bikes** - Weekly challenge demonstrating different stages of unit and feature tests. All code written test first. Completed as a pairing excercise [here](https://github.com/mattfreeman-london/boris-bikes) and as a solo effort [here.](https://github.com/jonesandy/boris-bikes)
  * **Airport** - Weekend solo challenge tackled using TDD practises. Tests written first to drive production code. Repository [here](https://github.com/jonesandy/airport_challenge).
  * **Dice-app** - Simple one method program to begin TDD mindset. Uses srand for random behaviour stubbing. Repository [here](https://github.com/jonesandy/dice-app).
  * **TDD Exercises** - Folder of TDD exercises using examples from the course, websites and Codewars katas. Repository [here](https://github.com/jonesandy/tdd-exercises).

2. Pair using the driver-navigator style

  * **Boris-Bikes** - Weekly challenge completed as a pairing excercise [here](https://github.com/mattfreeman-london/boris-bikes).

4. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

  * **Encapsulation** - My example and explanation of encapsulation and SRP. Uses three classes to demonstrate and also includes write up in README file. Repository [here](https://github.com/jonesandy/encapsulation).
  


## Next week goal

Ask a cohort member to validate and review a piece of my code.

Keep a more detailed weekly goals sheet. Add reflections at the end of the week.
