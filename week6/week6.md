# Week 6 goals

By the end of the week I will be able to:

1. **Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs.**
2. **Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges).**
3. **Run stand-ups and retrospectives.**
4. **Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow.**
5. **Give and receive meaningful code review.**

## Evidence
1. **Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs.**
    * Creating [these](https://github.com/jonesandy/makersbnb#user-stories) user stories from the specification.
    * Effective use of Trello to manage these tasks and assign to team members/pairs. ![Trello Project Board](./_imgs/trello.png)

2. **Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges).**
    * Turning the [list](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/makersbnb/specification_and_mockups.md) of specifications into [user stories](https://github.com/jonesandy/makersbnb#user-stories).

3. **Run stand-ups and retrospectives.**
    * Daily standups run to assign tasks and assess any blockers or project issues. ![Trello Project Board](./_imgs/standups.png)

4. **Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow.**
    * Use of branch for each user story. Once feature complete pull request sent and team member code reviews. ![Pull Requests](./_imgs/pull-requests.png)
    * [108](https://github.com/jonesandy/makersbnb/commits/master) commits across branches.

5. **Give and receive meaningful code review.**
    * Code reviews on [each](https://github.com/jonesandy/makersbnb/pull/7) pull request, with code comments before approval to merge.
