By the end of the week I will be able to:

1. **Use week 1 skills.**
2. **Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage.**
3. **Unit test classes in isolation using mocking.**
4. **Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change).**
5. **Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback.** :white_check_mark:
