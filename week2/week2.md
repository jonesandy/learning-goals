# Week 2 goals

By the end of the week I will be able to:

1. **Use week 1 skills.** :white_check_mark:
2. **Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage.** :white_check_mark:
3. **Unit test classes in isolation using mocking.** :white_check_mark:
4. **Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change).** :white_check_mark:
5. **Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback.** :white_check_mark:

## Evidence

1. **Use week 1 skills.**

    * Collaborating on weekly challenge with cohort members. Using pairing skills, TDD and Debugging approaches. Collaborated on these projects:    
[Ali Phipps](https://github.com/ali-phipps/oystercard) Oystercard project.    
[Elfi Yang](https://github.com/elfiyang16/oystercard) Oystercard project.

2. **Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage.**

    * [Ali Phipps](https://github.com/ali-phipps/oystercard) Oystercard project. Project breaks one class out while maintaining test coverage.    

3. **Unit test classes in isolation using mocking.**

    * Completed skills workshop on [mocking](https://github.com/jonesandy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-2/mocking_2/spec).
    * Completed testing classes in isolation [practical](https://github.com/jonesandy/testing_relationships_between_classes).
    * Worked on dependency injection [practical](https://github.com/jonesandy/dependency-injection) to practice using mocks.

4. **Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change).**

    * Worked on understanding basic [domain modelling](https://github.com/jonesandy/domain-modelling).
    * Working on [inheritance](https://github.com/jonesandy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-2/inheritance) workshop. Inheritance allows us to make code flexible by creating a super class that other classes can inherit from. Uses the 'is a type of' relationship to create the new class. Can make even more flexible by using composition and modules. Changes the relationship to a 'has a' so we can include only elements we need in the class. This means these elements can change as they control their internal workings.

5. **Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback.**
