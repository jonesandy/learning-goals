# Week 2 goals

By the end of the week I will be able to:

1. **Use week 1 skills.**
2. **Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage.**
3. **Unit test classes in isolation using mocking.** :white_check_mark:
4. **Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change).**
5. **Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback.** :white_check_mark:

## Evidence

1. **Use week 1 skills.**

    * Collaborating on weekly challenge with cohort members. Using pairing skills, TDD and Debugging approaches. Collaborated on these projects:    
[Ali Phipps](https://github.com/ali-phipps/oystercard) Oystercard project.    
[Elfi Yang](https://github.com/elfiyang16/oystercard) Oystercard project.

3. **Unit test classes in isolation using mocking.**

    * Completed skills workshop on [mocking](https://github.com/jonesandy/skills-workshops/tree/master/week-2/mocking_2/spec).
    * Completed testing classes in isolation [practical](https://github.com/jonesandy/testing_relationships_between_classes).

4. **Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change).**

    * Worked on understanding basic [domain modelling](https://github.com/jonesandy/domain-modelling).

5. **Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback.**

    * Reviewed [this codebase](https://github.com/fahus/airport_challenge) with comments on [pull request](https://github.com/makersacademy/airport_challenge/pull/1590).
