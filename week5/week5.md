# Week 5 goals

By the end of the week I will be able to:

1. **Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript.**
2. **Follow an effective process for learning a new language.**

## Evidence

1. **Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript.**
    * Created simple front-end app mimicking a [thermostat](https://github.com/jonesandy/thermostat).
    * Test driving a simple [JavaBuzz](https://github.com/jonesandy/js-fizzbuzz) program.
    * [Airport](https://github.com/jonesandy/js-airport) challenge revisited to gain understanding of Mocks/Spies in Jasmine.

2. **Follow an effective process for learning a new language.**
    * Translating knowledge of existing language into new language. As shown [here](https://github.com/jonesandy/learning-goals/blob/master/week5/ruby-to-javascript.md).
    * Play with small apps like [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/jonesandy/js-fizzbuzz). Taking small katas that I am familiar with and making them in a new language.

**PLAN** -     
**EVIDENCE** - 

## Reflection

### What went well

Transitioning into a new language was easier than I expected. What helped was taking already familiar concepts and trying to work out how to do them in JavaScript. It provided a decent map of how the language works from a high level. What some of the syntax looks like and conventions. 

I think my thermostat app was built to a high standard. The code was well structured and the final product was functional and well designed and executed.

### What could have gone better

I would have liked to have completed more practicals and have created more code examples to reflect the amount of reading I had done on JavaScript. It definitely would have helped solidify some concepts better.

### Change for next week

Play with more code after reading about a topic or idea. It helps so much in retaining what I have read and understood.
